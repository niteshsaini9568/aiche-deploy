                Continuing the legacy of our last event 'Gaming Arena', we
                organized AIChE Gaming Night on 8th October 2023. This event
                included two of the most famous and competitive esports games
                'BGMI' and 'Valvorant'. It was a successful event organized in
                which many esports enthusiast teams participated. The winning
                team was awarded Rs. 1000. This gaming night created an
                energetic and competitive atmosphere among the participants and
                also the atmosphere. You would have loved the vibe.

                As industries evolve and educational paradigms shift, webinars
                emerge as the dynamic intersection where industrial insights
                meet educational advancement. AIChE organized various webinars
                for chemistry lovers where many experienced speakers were
                invited and shared their valuable and insightful thoughts about
                the chemical industry and future educational opportunities. You
                know spreading knowledge is considered the biggest donation a
                man could make and gaining it makes you a great man.
