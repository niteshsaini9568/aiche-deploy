                Chem-Market Bidding
              </h2>
              <p>
                In the final round of UrjaXperience, the Chem-Market Bidding
                Challenge ignited entrepreneurial spirit and innovation on
                campus. Students tackled the extraction of alumina from its ore,
                optimizing efficiency and cost for equipment like grinders and
                filters. Success hinged on balancing performance and budget,
                with the lowest bid winning. As bids rose, participants
                showcased their chemical engineering knowledge and
                problem-solving skills. The event highlighted the best of
                entrepreneurship and innovation. Winners were celebrated for
                their achievements, embodying the dedication to push limits and
                inspire big dreams.
