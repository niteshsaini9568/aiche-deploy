                ONLINE SESSIONS
              </h2>
              <p>
                Virtual events and webinars were conducted to supplement missed
                lab experiences. Topics included "The Rusting of Iron in 3D
                Animations," aimed at enhancing students' comprehension of
                oxidation mechanisms and influencing factors. Through immersive
                3D simulations, participants gained insights into rust formation
                and propagation on iron surfaces, deepening their understanding
                of chemical reactions. These sessions provided a dynamic
                platform for visualizing complex concepts, offering students a
                unique perspective on real-world.

                SCIENCE EXTRAVAGANZA
              </h2>
              <p>
                The AIChE RGIPT K-12 team conducted two captivating experiments,
                igniting students' curiosity and fostering creativity. The
                Dancing Raisin experiment showcased how gas bubbles induce
                buoyancy, while the Balloon Inflation experiment illuminated
                chemical reactions between acids and bases. These engaging
                activities offered a profound understanding of scientific
                principles. They served as a gateway for students to explore
                STEM wonders, empowering them with knowledge and confidence. As
                the adage goes, 'Learning demands passion and unwavering effort.

                Unlocking Science for K-12 students: Offline Events Inspires
                Hands-On Learning
              </h2>
              <p>
                Our offline event for K-12 , featured fun experiments like
                "Denser Than You Think" and "Balloon Inflation." These
                activities helped students understand scientific concepts
                practically. Designed without lab equipment, these experiments
                made learning engaging and accessible, demonstrating that
                science can be both fun and informative outside traditional
                classroom settings.This provides a platform for visualizing
                concepts.
